# fill-and-insert-files
Programs for filling and inserting space for numbered files with common prefixes.

NOTE: This code does not preserve the original amount of files.  Be warned.

    fillingGaps.py - Finds all files with a given prefix in a single folder and
    locates any gaps in the numbering. It will rename the files to close the gap.
    
    insertGaps.py - Finds all files with a given prefix in a single folder and
    inserts a gap in the numbering. It renames a file to create a gap.
